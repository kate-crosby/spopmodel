<h2>spopmodel: A package for modeling fish population dynamics.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>spopmodel</code> employs a female-based Leslie Matrix to
evaluate population dynamics (specifically population growth
rate, <i>&lambda;</i>) over varying exploitation (<i>&mu;</i>). Model inputs
expects age-specific probalities of spawning &amp; survival, age-specific
fecundity, and age distribution proportional to some estimated abundance.
<code>spopmodel</code>'s creation stems from the collaborative efforts
of University of Idaho and CA Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife.
</p>


<h3>Age Distribution</h3>

<p>Age frequency scaled to some absolute abundance estimate (see example
below). Model requires young (i.e., age-0; age-1) fish, so values from
literature (or other sources) may be necessary to complete data gaps.
</p>
<p>Example:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>freq_{age_{i}} \times \hat{abund}</i></p>



<h3>Survival Probability</h3>

<p>Survival at age (as assigned in Age Distribution). Again values can be
filled in where needed. Probability to be adjusted downward for ages
affected by exploitation (<i>&mu;</i>). In the case of White Sturgeon for
example, survival estimated at ~0.94, and for ages 10-15 adjusted downard
by ~0.13. These ages vunerable to fishing mortality.
</p>


<h3>Spawning Probability</h3>

<p>Probability based on first age of maturity. For White Sturgeon (as an
example), this is ~age-10. Again, probability should be in-line with
ages set in Age Distribution, and this may require setting to 0 age-0
through age-&lt;first age maturity&gt;-1.
</p>


<h3>Fecundity</h3>

<p>Number of eggs per age, starting with first age of maturity. If data are
lacking, may need to consult literature for species in question.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For probability datasets &amp; fecundity, some measure of error (i.e.,
standard deviation) per value is required. These values are used in the
simulation process.
